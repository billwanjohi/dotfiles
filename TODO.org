#+TITLE: Todo

* TODO move chezmoi-managed config files into one subdirectory

https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/customize-your-source-directory/#use-a-subdirectory-of-your-dotfiles-repo-as-the-root-of-the-source-state

maybe "chezmoi-home", to distinguish from leftover homesick-managed files

Not sure what this does to scripts

- [ ] manually clean up files that weren't supposed to be in $HOME


* TODO try .chezmoitemplates instead of branching in .chezmoi.toml.tmpl

[[https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/special-files-and-directories/chezmoidata-format/][.chezmoidata.<format>]] does not allow templating, [[https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/1663#issuecomment-981071886][by design]],
so we are instead branching depending on OS in .chezmoi.toml.tmpl.

Another way of accomplishing this would be to put the branching
logic in templates inside of .chezmoitemplates, and then render those.
