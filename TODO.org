#+TITLE: Todo

* TODO move chezmoi-managed config files into one subdirectory

https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/advanced/customize-your-source-directory/#use-a-subdirectory-of-your-dotfiles-repo-as-the-root-of-the-source-state

maybe "chezmoi-home", to distinguish from leftover homesick-managed files

Not sure what this does to scripts
