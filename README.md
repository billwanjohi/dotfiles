# dotfiles

This was a homesick castle, and is in the process of being shifted over to being managed via chezmoi.
You can pull and symlink using the homesick ruby gem and the chezmoi go package,
or just do so manually.

## Setup

1. [perform one-line binary install](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/#one-line-binary-install)
2. [Init from repo](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/setup/#use-a-hosted-repo-to-manage-your-dotfiles-across-multiple-machines)
